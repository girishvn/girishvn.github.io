          ~ Education ~<br>
          <br>
          I am currently a PhD student at the <a href="https://www.washington.edu/" class="purple">University of Washington Seattle</a>
          working in the <a href="https://ubicomplab.cs.washington.edu/" class="orange">UbiComp Lab</a>.<br>
          I am oringally from Boulder, CO and attended the <a href="https://www.washington.edu/" class="yellow">University of Colorado Boulder</a> where I<br>
           majored in electrical and computer engineering with a minor in computer science.<br>
          <br>

          ~ Interests ~<br>

          <br>
          Ultimate Frisbee:<br>
          While at CU, I played club ultimate frisbee for <a href="https://www.mamabird.com/" class="yellow">Mamabird</a>, a top 5 collegiate program.<br>
          I recently (pre-Covid) had the opportunity to return to <a href="https://www.fairviewhs.org/" class="red">Fairview HS</a> to coach the program I had<br>
          once played for.<br>
          <br>
          Shotokan Karate:<br>
          I am a first degree black belt and practiced for several years at the
          <a href="http://imakarate.com/" class="black">I.M.A (International<br> Martialarts Association)</a>.<br>
          <br>
          Being Outdoors:<br>
          I love camping, hiking, backpacking, skiing, biking, and basically doing anything outside. I've been lucky<br>
          enough to grow up in a place (Boulder) that provides easy access to all of these activities. I am excited <br>
          to move to Seattle and to explore everything the PNW has to offer!<br>
          <br>
          Photography:<br>
          I enjoy taking pictures of all the neat places I've explored. A compilation of my pictures can be<br>
          found on my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/gvn_photos/" class="red">Instagram</a>.<br>
          <br>
          Drawing:<br>
          I recently (during the early months of covid-quarentine) picked up drawing again. I have yet to post<br>
          any of my work, but will update this section once I get the chance to do so!<br>
