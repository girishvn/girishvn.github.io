# Personal Website
This repo contains the source code and images for my personal website

The repo is organized in the following way:

HTML: all html files are stored in the root directory

CSS: all css files are stored in the css folder 
and are sourced by the html files

Javascript: all JS is embedded in the html files 
(not enought to justify its own file)

Images: all images are stored in the imgs folder. 
This folder contains three seperate directorys. 
One dir contains social media icons, one dir contains pictures of me (Girish), 
and the final dir contains space images used as the background of the home page.

PDFs: all pdfs, namely my resume, are stored in the pdfs directory
